# Arlington Sprouts Store Neo4j Integration

This README provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the program.

## Programming Languages and Systems:

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Database System:** Neo4j (Graph Database)
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** 
    - `neo4j` - For establishing a connection and executing Cypher queries on the Neo4j instance.
    - `csv` - For reading and parsing CSV files.

## How to Run the Program:

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have Python (version 3.x) installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - Ensure you have a running instance of Neo4j. If not, you can [set up a Neo4j sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/) or install it locally from [Neo4j's official website](https://neo4j.com/download/).
    
2. **Setup:**
    - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Install the required Python libraries by running:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. **Configuration:**
    - Ensure the Neo4j credentials (username, password, and URI) in the program match your Neo4j instance.
    - Ensure the CSV files are placed in the `SproutsData` directory (or update the path in the program accordingly).

4. **Running the Program:**
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
    - Run the program using the following command:
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```

5. **Expected Output:**
    - The program will establish a connection with the Neo4j database, create nodes from the CSV files, establish relationships, and execute the defined Cypher queries.
    - On successful execution, you will see the nodes and relationships formed in your Neo4j database and any relevant console outputs.
